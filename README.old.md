# Clicky Game

## Overview

In this assignment, I have created a memory game with React. 

### Instructions

1. The application shall render different images to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.

2. The application shall keep track of the user's score. The user's score shall be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.

7. When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.
